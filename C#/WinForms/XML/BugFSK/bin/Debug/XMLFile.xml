************** JIT Debugging **************
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this
application or computer (machine.config) must have the
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.
The application must also be compiled with debugging
enabled.

For example:

&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;

When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer
rather than be handled by this dialog box.

Appears to only happen when the height is set to 1021.

Genius idea: generate a series of images from 200px high to 2000px high, with a section of the map rendered on each one. Scan the bottom line of each image; if black pixels are encountered,
you may have another size where this issue occurs.</description></issue><issue type="Bug" title="Map location doesn't reset when loading a map" id="BCMC-17" priority="Critical" status="Closed"><description>When loading a map after scrolling around in a previous map, MapPosition.Y &amp; X are not reset: user is still viewing the old region when new map is loaded.</description></issue><issue type="Task" title="Investigate the posibility of adding some compression to the map files" id="BCMC-18" priority="High" status="Open"><description>Maps are too big on disk.
