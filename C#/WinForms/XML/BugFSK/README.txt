BugFSK is a quick and dirty bugtracker I whipped up; I had too much paper kicking around and I didn't want to piss around with setting up
a full-blown system, so I did this. It's essentially a skin around an XML file.

Might be useful for..er..

Okay, probably not useful. :P

Uses .NET 3.5. There's an old copy of the XML file it writes to in the bin directory, so you can see how it's formatted.
